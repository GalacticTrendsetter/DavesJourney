You did it Dave! Now we can get your powers back!
Swimmy places all the crystals onto your horn.
Suddenly, you feel normal again, like if your foot was asleep and then came back. 

 You go out onto the balcony and celebrate by launching fireworks from your horn.

(Swimmy) Hi Dave, what is it?
(You) I lost my magic powers this morning.
(Swimmy) Oh no!
He pauses and looks something up on his computer.
(Swimmy) Apparently you can get them back, you just need to find 4 magic crystals! Maybe you can find them. Look around!

        <result xml:space="preserve">(Kelp) Hi Dave.
(You) I lost my powers this morning! I need magic crystals!
(Kelp) Oh no! Well, you're in luck, because I have a way to make magic crystals! The only problem is that I need river water, and I lost my bucket. Also, I forgot where the river is.
(You) I'll get some river water for you!
(Kelp) I will make a crystal for you then!
